Outerspace
==========

Outerspace is an incomplete modern recreation of the classic computer game Starflight written in C# and Managed DirectX 9.0.

I leave it here as a testament to the countless hours I spent bedroom programming in an attempt to modernize a very historically significant computer game. 

The game isn't complete, but there's a lot of accomplishments in this code, especially for a few amateurs, in their spare time. Special thanks to Jason (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonwhenderson).

Here's a video:

If you clone the repository and attempt to run it, there is a compiled binary compatible with
Windows 7, DirectX 9.0C and .NET 1.1. in /bin.

Thanks, and enjoy!
